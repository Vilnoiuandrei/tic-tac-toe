# Tic Tac Toe with Multiple AI Levels

Welcome to Tic Tac Toe with Multiple AI Levels! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, with the added feature of playing against AI opponents of different difficulty levels.

## Features

- Play against the computer at various difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Impossible.
- Simple and intuitive interface for a smooth gaming experience.
- Keep track of your wins against each AI level.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic and user interface interaction.
- HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the game interface.
- ES6 features for modern JavaScript syntax.
- Responsive design principles for cross-device compatibility.


## Game Instructions

- Click on any empty cell on the game board to make a move.
- The game alternates between you (X) and the AI opponent (O).
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## AI Levels

- **Easy**: The AI makes random moves without any strategy.
- **Medium**: The AI has a basic strategy and tries to block the player from winning.
- **Impossible**: The AI uses the minimax algorithm to play optimally and cannot be beaten.
